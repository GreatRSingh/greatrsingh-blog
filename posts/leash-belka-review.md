# What was it?

Our team BlackGrizz, comprising Rakshit Singh, Sonali Patra, and Rishi Das, participated in this competition with enthusiasm and dedication. Our approach involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including ensemble methods.

The "Predict New Medicines with BELKA" competition, hosted by Leash Biosciences in collaboration with NeurIPS 2024, aimed to advance drug discovery by predicting the binding affinity of small molecules to protein targets using machine learning models. This challenge sought to address the labor-intensive nature of traditional drug screening by utilizing a dataset of 133 million small molecules, enabling participants to develop computational methods for identifying promising drug candidates. The ultimate goal was to democratize computational drug discovery and accelerate the identification of new treatments.

Participants were tasked with creating models to predict which small molecules would bind to three specific protein targets. The competition emphasized innovative chemical representations and machine learning techniques to improve binding predictions. The top-performing teams had the opportunity to win significant cash prizes, with the results presented at the NeurIPS 2024 conference. This initiative highlighted the potential of ML to explore vast chemical spaces and contribute to the development of lifesaving medicines.
