So, now lets get on to fixing this problem. When you make a new notebook you will reach this page.

</p>

Click on the share button which is available in the menu. Doing this will open a internal tab allowing you to either share the notebook with a few peoples by keeping it private and searching them by there username. or make it public so that everyone can see.
