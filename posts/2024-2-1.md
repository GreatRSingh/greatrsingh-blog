Machine learning is a way of teaching computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. Computers can learn from data and identify patterns, which allows them to make predictions and decisions that would be difficult or impossible for humans to make.

> “People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they’re too stupid and they’ve already taken over the world.” — Pedro Domingos

## A general pipeline for Machine Learning is :

1. python
2. Numpy
3. Pandas and Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. Tensorflow / PyTorch — implementation know-how
6. Mathematics

### Python

**Python** is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is often used for web development, data science, and machine learning. Python has a large and active community, and there are many resources available to help you learn the language.

#### Some of the benefits of learning Python:

    It is easy to learn and use.
    It is powerful and versatile.
    It has a large and active community.
    It is free and open-source.

### Numpy

Nearly every scientist working in Python draws on the power of **NumPy**.

NumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant.
